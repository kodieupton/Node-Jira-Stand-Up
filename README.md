# Node Jira Stand Up

This is a little tool that I have set up to help automate the process of a task that I do on a daily basis.
Which is go through my Jira board, and look at what tasks are required to be worked on the following day.

Current set up is, run the code, which will create a markdown file for the day, which I will review before posting,
with the team communication channel.

### Upcoming ideas
- Check if there are any pull requests which are required attention on the Jira cards.
- Pull through cards which are in testing, that will require testing the following day.
- Connect to to team communication channel to automate the process that little bit more.
